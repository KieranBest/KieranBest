## Hi there 👋

🎧 Gaming
🐶 Dog walking
🏂 Snowboarding

- 🔭 I’m currently working on creating a gaming portfolio in order to break into the gaming industry. I have already created a small game of chase called 'Tircle' which you can view [here](https://github.com/KieranBest/Tircle#readme) using unity, however with recent developments I have chosen to branch out.
- 🌱 Therefore I’m currently learning UE5.3 specifically gameplay mechanics with a view to create a range of different game genre demos. [That's My Bird](https://github.com/KieranBest/Thats-My-Bird) is my current project, building a platformer based on an evil villain stealing your bird and taking your memory. From this you can have 3 abilities, this will add more strategic planning to the game. Abilities will include:
  - Walk Right
  - Walk Left
  - Jump
  - Double Jump
  - Sprint
  - Jump & boost in moving direction
  - Attack
I've decided to only make small demo worth games in order to build my knowledge of various concepts.

- ⚡ Fun fact: Before 2023, I'd never created my own game from scratch without any kind of tutorial.

- 🤔 I’m looking for any advice to build my portfolio whether that be advice on what to build or even how to present, any advice would be greatly appreciated.
