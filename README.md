- 🔭 I’m currently working as a Junior Product Developer but love to create games and other applications on the side. You can take a look at my creations here on my github profile.
- 🌱 I've created small demo worth games along with other various small projects in order to build my knowledge of various concepts.

- ⚡ Fun fact: Before 2023, I'd never created my own application from scratch without any kind of tutorial/guidance.
- ⚡ I created a small website for fun just to see everything I think is worth showing [here](https://kieranbest.github.io/)
