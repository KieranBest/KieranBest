- 🔭 I’m currently working as a Junior Product Developer but love to create games on the side. You can take a look at my creations here on my github profile.
- 🌱 I was initially using Unity however with recent developments I have chosen to branch out. Therefore I’m currently learning UE5 specifically gameplay mechanics with a view to create a range of different game genre demos. [That's My Bird](https://github.com/KieranBest/Thats-My-Bird) is my current project, building a platformer based on an evil villain stealing your bird and taking your memory. From this you can have 3 abilities, this will add more strategic planning to the game. Abilities will include:
  - Walk Right
  - Walk Left
  - Jump
  - Double Jump
  - Sprint
  - Jump & boost in moving direction
  - Attack
I've decided to only make small demo worth games in order to build my knowledge of various concepts.

- ⚡ Fun fact: Before 2023, I'd never created my own game from scratch without any kind of tutorial.
