- 🔭 I’m currently working as a Junior Product Developer but love to create applications/games on the side. You can take a look at my creations here on my github profile.
- 🌱 I'm also working as a freelance web developer, take a look [here](www.bestwebdev.co.uk) for my website.

- ⚡ Fun fact: Before 2023, I'd never created my own application from scratch without any kind of tutorial/guidance.
